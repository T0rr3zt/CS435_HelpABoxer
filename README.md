# CS435_HelpABoxer
This Project is from my second year at Pacific University. This was a group project, and the goal was to come up with a protype/idea for developing. The idea that my group pick was the idea that I had. The prototype is an idea of an app that would be campus centered to help new students feel comfortable in a new campus. The prototype was a a final project in out intro to human interation course. The software that we used to develop the project was Indigo Studio.
